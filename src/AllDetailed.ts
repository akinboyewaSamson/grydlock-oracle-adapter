 * TypeScript treats it as homomorphic and preserves the array/tuple shape
 * (length and per-index element types), rather than distributing over
 * `length`/`push`/etc. the way a naive `keyof` mapped type would for a
 * non-array object type.
 *
 * Exported because {@link AllDetailed} is defined in terms of it; consumers
 * normally use {@link AllDetailed} directly.

 * chain composition's detail-propagation for the `FallbackOracle`/
 * `RiskOracleAggregator` "array of tiers" shape.
 *
 * An empty array resolves to `true` (vacuously detailed). This matches the
 * standard convention for a universally-quantified property over an empty
 * set — the same convention `[].every(predicate) === true` uses at
 * runtime — and is otherwise moot in practice: a chain of zero tiers has no
 * runtime meaning to preserve either (see `FallbackOracle.route`'s

/**
 * Generic `RiskOracle` -> `BatchRiskOracle` adapter.
 *
 * Scheduling policy, in one pass per `scheduleTick()`:
 *
 * 1. **Admission (confidence-targeted deadline feasibility).** For every
 *    queued, not-yet-started item, estimate P(service latency <= time
 *    remaining until its deadline) from the live {@link LatencyEstimator}.
 *    If that probability is below `targetConfidence` — including the
 *    trivial case where time has already run out — the item is rejected
 *    immediately as `deadline-rejected` rather than started and left to
 *    blow the deadline, or left queued burning down its remaining budget
 *    for nothing. This check re-runs as real time passes (via a timer, see
 *    below), not just once at enqueue time, because an item that was
 *    feasible when queued can become infeasible purely by waiting for a
 *    concurrency slot — that queueing delay is the "current concurrency
 *    pressure" input the admission decision must account for.
 * 2. **Priority + feasibility, combined (not layered).** Among items that
 *    survive admission, the next one dispatched into a free concurrency
 *    slot is chosen by a weighted score of aged priority and estimated
 *    feasibility (`priorityWeight` / `feasibilityWeight`), not by priority
 *    alone. A high-priority item estimated unlikely to make the deadline
 *    does not automatically preempt a lower-priority item estimated very
 *    likely to make it; the weights make the tradeoff explicit and tunable
 *    instead of being an accident of iteration order.
 * 3. **Starvation freedom via aging.** A queued item's effective priority
 *    grows by `agingRatePerMs` for every millisecond it waits:
 *    `effective = priority + agingRatePerMs * waitTimeMs`. Consequently,
 *    against sustained load from items of at most `priorityNormalization`
 *    priority, any queued item's effective priority overtakes them once it
 *    has waited
 *      `(priorityNormalization - priority) / agingRatePerMs` ms,
 *    after which it wins the combined-score comparison against every
 *    freshly-arrived competitor and is the next one dispatched into a free
 *    slot. That quantity is therefore the bound on a low-priority item's
 *    expected wait *for the top of the queue*; its actual expected wait
 *    also includes however long the queue takes to produce a free slot,
 *    which is a function of `maxConcurrency` and the wrapped oracle's own
 *    latency, not of this scheduler.
 *
 * Duplicate destinations within one `getScores` call are coalesced so the
 * wrapped oracle is called at most once per distinct destination; every
 * requested occurrence still receives its own (identical) result.

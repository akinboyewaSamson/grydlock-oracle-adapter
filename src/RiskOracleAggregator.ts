 *
 * This measure defeats that by dropping the `faultTolerance` values

 * the worst case for an attacker is exactly parity with the honest-only
 * average (dropping only their own manufactured near-zero terms) — they can
 * never push the surviving average, and therefore the confidence derived
 * from it, below the honest sources' own natural disagreement. Any
 * coalition strategy that fails to fully occupy the dropped slots leaves at
 * least one adversarial value in the kept (larger-distance) set, which can
 * only raise the average further. This is verified empirically by the
 * adversarial coalition search in RiskOracleAggregator.adversarial.test.ts.

/**
 * Byzantine-fault-tolerant `DetailedRiskOracle` that fuses `n` independently

 *
 * ## Algorithm
 *
 * 1. Query every configured source concurrently, each individually bounded
 *    by {@link withTimeout}. Resolve as soon as `quorum` have answered
 *    successfully (or reject with {@link QuorumNotMetError} the moment
 *    reaching quorum becomes impossible) — a hung source never blocks the
 *    result past its own timeout budget once quorum is otherwise reachable.
 * 2. Compute a reputation-weighted median of the successful reports (see
 *    {@link weightedMedian}) as the preferred estimate.
 * 3. Clamp that estimate into {@link honestOrderBounds}. This step alone
 *    is what guarantees the returned score falls within the honest
 *    sources' `[min, max]` range for any `<= faultTolerance` Byzantine
 *    sources, given `sources.length >= 2 * faultTolerance + 1` — and it
 *    holds regardless of the weights used in step 2, so reputation can
 *    never be leveraged to break it.
 * 4. Calibrate confidence from {@link computeDisagreement} of the raw
 *    reports around the final aggregate: `1 / (1 + dispersion /
 *    confidenceScale)`, in `(0, 1]`, strictly decreasing in dispersion and
 *    capped at `1` only when every source (after discounting the
 *    `faultTolerance` closest to the aggregate) agrees exactly.
 * 5. Update each responding source's reputation: an exponential moving
 *    average of `1 - |report - aggregate| / 100` for a successful
 *    response, or `0` for a response that failed/timed out in time to be
 *    counted this call. A source's reputation is never touched by a call
 *    it did not settle for in time.
 *
 * ## Statefulness
 *
 * Reputation is kept in-memory, in a `Map` keyed by source label, for the
 * lifetime of the `RiskOracleAggregator` instance. It is lazily initialized
 * to full trust (`1`) the first time a source responds, is updated after
 * every call per the rule above, and is never persisted — a process
 * restart resets every source to full trust. Use
 * {@link RiskOracleAggregator.getReputationSnapshot} to inspect or persist
 * it externally if needed.
 *
 * ## Failure
 *
 * If fewer than `quorum` sources answer successfully — including the
 * zero-successful-sources case — `getScore`/`getScoreDetailed` reject with
 * {@link QuorumNotMetError}.

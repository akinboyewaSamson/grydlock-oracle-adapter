/**
 * Cost-aware, confidence-weighted, stale-while-revalidate cache middleware
 * (issue: replaces #6's binary-TTL, insertion-order-evicting cache).
 *
 * ## Eviction: a GreedyDual adaptation
 *
 * Plain LRU (or this middleware's original insertion-order eviction) treats
 * every entry as equally worth keeping. That's wrong once entries are
 * heterogeneous: a destination that was expensive to fetch and came back
 * with high confidence is more valuable to keep cached than one that was
 * cheap and low-confidence, independent of which was touched more recently.
 *
 * This adapts GreedyDual (Cao & Irani, "Cost-Aware WWW Proxy Caching
 * Algorithms", 1997) — the degenerate, uniform-size member of the
 * GreedyDual-Size family, since every cache entry here is one score (no
 * variable object size to weight by). Each entry carries a priority value:
 *
 * ```
 * h(entry) = L + costMs(entry) * confidence(entry)
 * ```
 *
 * `costMs` is an EMA of measured latency refetching that destination from
 * the wrapped oracle (a genuinely expensive destination gets more credit).
 * `confidence` in `[0, 1]` scales that credit down for entries the source
 * itself trusts less (a confidence of 0 collapses an entry's credit to
 * `L` — the wrapped oracle vouching for the value at all is what earns it
 * any protection). `L` is a monotonically non-decreasing "clock": on every
 * access (hit or fresh fetch), `h` is recomputed against the *current* `L`,
 * so a recently-touched entry is pushed ahead of `L` by its own credit —
 * this is what gives GreedyDual its recency behavior without a separate
 * recency term. On eviction, the entry with the *smallest* `h` is evicted,
 * and `L` is advanced to that evicted value — so the "cost floor" every
 * surviving entry must clear only rises when something is actually evicted,
 * never on its own. With uniform cost/confidence across all entries this
 * degenerates to exactly the recency ordering of LRU; GreedyDual (unweighted
 * by size) is proven k-competitive against the optimal offline eviction
 * schedule, where k is cache capacity — see
 * tests/withCache.competitive.test.ts for an empirical demonstration on
 * fixed traces against a DP-computed optimal baseline, which lands far
 * inside that bound for realistic (non-adversarial) access patterns.
 *
 * Eviction bookkeeping uses a binary min-heap over `h`, keyed with lazy
 * deletion: every access pushes a fresh node and bumps the entry's
 * `version`; a popped node is discarded (not evicted) if its version no
 * longer matches the entry's current one. Each node is pushed once and
 * popped at most once over its lifetime, so touch/evict is O(log n)
 * *amortized* — the occasional run of discarded stale pops is paid for by
 * the touches that pushed them, not charged again to later operations.
 * Because nothing ever pops nodes for entries that are merely *not*
 * evicted, the heap can accumulate more nodes than there are live entries
 * over a long-running cache; once it exceeds `2 * entries.size`, it's
 * rebuilt from scratch (one node per live entry) — an O(n) rebuild
 * triggered only once per Θ(n) touches, which preserves the amortized
 * O(log n) bound while keeping total memory bounded by `maxEntries`
 * instead of growing without limit.
 *
 * ## Stale-while-revalidate
 *
 * Once an entry is past `ttlMs` but still within `ttlMs + staleMs`, calls
 * are served the stale value immediately ('cache-stale') while at most one
 * background revalidation is in flight for that destination — tracked with
 * this middleware's own `Set<string>`, entirely independent of
 * `CoalescingOracle` (a separate concern, not imported or duplicated here).
 * Because the stale-serving branch never awaits anything before deciding
 * whether to start a revalidation, N callers issued in the same
 * synchronous burst are guaranteed to see a consistent view of that
 * tracking set — JavaScript never interleaves two calls to the same
 * function without an intervening `await` — so exactly one revalidation
 * starts regardless of how many callers arrive concurrently. A failed
 * revalidation is logged and otherwise ignored: the still-valid stale entry
 * is left untouched (not evicted, not corrupted), and the rejection is
 * caught here so it can never surface as unhandled.
 *
 * If the entry is evicted by capacity pressure while a revalidation for it
 * is in flight, the revalidation's result is dropped on arrival rather than
 * resurrecting the entry — the cache already decided that destination
 * wasn't worth keeping.
 *
 * The returned oracle implements `DetailedRiskOracle`: `cacheStatus` is
 * `'live'` on a fresh fetch, `'cache-fresh'`/`'cache-stale'` on a hit in
 * either window. Composing `ProvenanceOracle(withCache(...)(inner))`
 * reports this accurately with no changes to `ProvenanceOracle.ts` — it
 * already prefers a wrapped `DetailedRiskOracle`'s own reported status.

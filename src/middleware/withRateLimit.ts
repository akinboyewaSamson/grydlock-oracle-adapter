/**
 * Cross-context, gossip-coordinated rate limit (issue #73), built on the
 * shared middleware abstraction (#46). Bounds the *combined* outgoing
 * `getScore` rate across every JS context that composes this middleware onto
 * the same `BroadcastChannel` — a single browser-extension "client" is often
 * several independent realms (a Manifest V3 background service worker plus
 * one or more content-script contexts) with no shared memory and no
 * synchronous coordination primitive.
 *
 * ## Why a CRDT, and which one
 *
 * The design space (see the issue's hints) is roughly: (a) a leader-elected
 * coordinator holding the real budget, (b) generous fixed per-context
 * sub-budgets with no coordination at all, or (c) a CRDT-merged approximate
 * shared view. This implements (c), specifically a **G-Counter (grow-only
 * counter) CRDT, indexed by (contextId, time-bucket)** rather than a single
 * scalar per replica:
 *
 * - **Why not (a), leader election:** `BroadcastChannel` gives no consensus
 *   primitive, and a Manifest V3 service worker can be suspended and woken
 *   at any time — a "leader" context can vanish silently mid-term with no
 *   way for the others to detect that synchronously. Leader election under
 *   these constraints needs its own failure-detection/re-election protocol,
 *   which is strictly more machinery than the problem needs, and every
 *   design still has to answer "what does a context do while leaderless?" —
 *   which is exactly what the gossip-CRDT answers directly.
 * - **Why not (b), generous static sub-budgets with no coordination:**
 *   simplest to implement, but it either wastes most of the budget (each of
 *   `N` contexts capped at `budget/N_max` for some assumed worst-case
 *   `N_max`, even when only one context is actually active) or is unsafe
 *   (no cap at all, or a cap sized for the common case that a burst of new
 *   contexts blows through). It also cannot satisfy "exact single-context
 *   behavior when alone" (acceptance criterion) without *knowing* it's
 *   alone, which requires the very discovery mechanism gossip provides.
 * - **Why a G-Counter over a PN-Counter:** admitted-request counts within a
 *   bucket only ever go up during that bucket's life — there is no
 *   "decrement" event, only expiry (handled by dropping old buckets, not by
 *   subtracting). A PN-Counter's negative half would be dead weight.
 * - **Why bucketed instead of one scalar per replica:** a single ever-
 *   growing per-replica counter can't express a *sliding* window (you'd
 *   only ever be able to ask "how many total, ever", not "how many in the
 *   last `windowMs`"). Bucketing by time turns "prune" into "drop old
 *   buckets", which is also what keeps memory bounded (see below) — an
 *   un-bucketed G-Counter would have to be reset out-of-band and could never
 *   forget stale contexts.
 *
 * ## CRDT structure and merge
 *
 * State is `Map<contextId, Map<bucketIndex, count>>`. Only a context's own
 * `contextId` slot is ever written locally (on an admitted request); every
 * other slot is populated purely by merging received gossip. `bucketIndex`
 * is `floor(t / bucketMs)`. Merging an incoming `(contextId, bucketIndex,
 * count)` triple takes the pointwise max against any existing value for that
 * key. Because a context's own bucket count is monotonically
 * non-decreasing for the bucket's lifetime, pointwise max is:
 *
 * - **idempotent** — merging the same message twice changes nothing after
 *   the first time (`max(x, x) = x`), so duplicate delivery is harmless.
 * - **commutative** — `max(max(a,b),c) = max(a,max(b,c))` for any arrival
 *   order, so out-of-order or repeated delivery converges to the same state.
 * - **associative** — merges can be batched/replayed in any grouping with
 *   the same result.
 *
 * These three properties (the definition of a state-based CRDT) are what
 * make "no message ordering or delivery guarantee" survivable at all —
 * `tests/withRateLimit.crdt-properties.test.ts` proves them directly via
 * randomized merge-order trials, not just "it seemed to work."
 *
 * ## Admission rule (two independent checks, both must pass)
 *
 * 1. **Global estimate check:** `sum(all known contexts' in-window buckets)
 *    + 1 <= budget`. This is the CRDT-merged approximate view of the shared
 *    budget.
 * 2. **Local fair-share check:** `thisContext's own in-window count + 1 <=
 *    ceil(budget / knownContextCount)`, where `knownContextCount` is the
 *    number of distinct contextIds currently tracked (always >= 1, since a
 *    context always knows about itself). This is a purely local invariant —
 *    it does not require receiving anything — and is what gives the design
 *    a provable bound even under total gossip loss (see below), and what
 *    makes the single-context case exact: with no gossip partners ever
 *    observed, `knownContextCount` stays `1` forever, so the fair-share cap
 *    equals `budget` and check 2 never restricts anything the global check
 *    (which, with no other contexts, is tracking exactly this context's own
 *    count) doesn't already enforce — i.e. it degenerates to exactly a
 *    single-process sliding-window counter, not an approximation of one.
 *
 * ## The overshoot bound
 *
 * There are two bounds worth stating, because they answer two different
 * questions: "what's the absolute worst case, no matter what?" and "what
 * does gossip actually buy us once it's working?"
 *
 * **Bound 1 — unconditional, provable by construction, no assumptions about
 * `BroadcastChannel` delivery at all:**
 *
 * ```
 * combined admissions in any trailing window  <=  N * budget
 * ```
 *
 * where `N` is the number of contexts that admitted at least one request in
 * that window. This follows directly from check 1 alone, with no help from
 * check 2 and no assumption that any gossip ever arrives: check 1 requires
 * `estimate + 1 <= budget` before every admission, and `estimate` always
 * includes this context's own count (it's a sum over all known contexts,
 * including itself) — so `estimate >= ownCount` always, which means every
 * individual context's own admitted count, within its own view of any
 * trailing window, never exceeds `budget`, *purely from checking its own
 * arithmetic against its own (possibly totally isolated) state*. Summing
 * `N` individually-bounded contexts gives `N * budget`. This is what makes
 * the overshoot *provably bounded* even in the fundamental worst case: two
 * contexts permanently, totally partitioned from each other (every message
 * between them lost forever) each correctly and independently cap
 * themselves at `budget` — neither can silently become unbounded, they just
 * fail to *share* the budget, which is the best any purely-gossip-based
 * design can guarantee when delivery isn't guaranteed at all (proving
 * anything tighter than this would require a delivery guarantee
 * `BroadcastChannel` does not provide).
 * `tests/withRateLimit.adversarial-gossip.test.ts` asserts this bound as a
 * hard invariant — it must hold on every one of 200+ randomized adversarial
 * runs, since it's true by construction regardless of loss/reorder/duplication.
 *
 * **Bound 2 — the design's actual payoff, once gossip is working:** once
 * every pair of active contexts has exchanged at least one message (rosters
 * converged), check 2's fair-share cap (`ceil(budget / knownContextCount)`)
 * additionally restricts each context, tightening the combined bound to
 *
 * ```
 * budget + N   (pure ceil() rounding slop: N contexts each independently
 *              capped at ceil(budget/N) over-count budget by at most N-1
 *              when summed)
 * ```
 *
 * This is *why* the gossip/CRDT machinery exists at all — without it, every
 * context would only ever have bound 1 (`N * budget`) available to it, with
 * no way to safely tighten to a fair split even when peers are perfectly
 * reachable. `tests/withRateLimit.adversarial-gossip.test.ts` checks this
 * one as an empirical, convergence-dependent expectation (comfortably
 * loose, to stay non-flaky under randomized loss) rather than a hard
 * per-run invariant like bound 1, and demonstrates it separately for a
 * lossless control run vs. lossy/reordered/duplicated runs.
 *
 * ## Why throttled-eager broadcast instead of `setInterval`
 *
 * A naive periodic timer stops firing the instant a Manifest V3 service
 * worker context is suspended — exactly the failure mode the issue calls
 * out — and a suspended timer fails silently (no error, just stale gossip).
 * Instead, this middleware broadcasts its own updated bucket state
 * immediately after an admission, but at most once per `gossipIntervalMs`
 * (a trailing-edge throttle keyed off the injectable clock, not a running
 * timer). A context with no new admissions has nothing new to say and isn't
 * running a timer to say it with; a context that resumes after suspension
 * broadcasts on its very next admission, catching peers up without waiting
 * out an unrelated fixed period. This also makes the whole middleware
 * driven entirely by `getScore` calls plus inbound messages — no
 * `setInterval`/`setTimeout` to fake, mock, or leak in tests.
 *
 * ## Bounded memory (issue constraint: O(1) amortized, bounded regardless
 * of lifetime message count)
 *
 * Every `getScore` call first drops buckets older than `windowMs` from
 * every tracked context, and drops a context entirely once it has zero
 * remaining buckets (except this context's own slot, which is never
 * dropped so local admission always has somewhere to record). State size is
 * therefore bounded by `(currently-or-recently-active context count) ×
 * ceil(windowMs / bucketMs)`, independent of how many gossip messages have
 * ever been received over the process's lifetime — a context that stops
 * broadcasting (closed tab, permanently suspended worker) ages out of every
 * peer's state within one window, not never.
 *
 * ## Degrading to single-context behavior
 *
 * If no `BroadcastChannel` is available (`channel` is `null`/unset and the
 * global `BroadcastChannel` constructor doesn't exist — e.g. Node under
 * Vitest with no polyfill), no gossip is sent or received; `knownContextCount`
 * is permanently `1`. Both admission checks then operate purely on this
 * context's own count against the full `budget`, over the same sliding
 * window — an exact, not approximate, single-process sliding-window rate
 * limiter, verified directly in
 * `tests/withRateLimit.single-context.test.ts` against a from-scratch
 * baseline implementation.

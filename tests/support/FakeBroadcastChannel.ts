 * Test double for `BroadcastChannel`, used to simulate multiple independent
 * JS contexts (issue #73) coordinating over a shared, adversarial,
 * asynchronous bus — without real timers, so simulations stay deterministic
 * and fast.
 *
 * Delivery is driven entirely by the test: `postMessage` only *enqueues* a
 * delivery (subject to configured loss/duplication and a randomized delay
 * that causes reordering); nothing is actually delivered to a listener until
 * the test calls {@link FakeBroadcastChannelBus.deliverUpTo} with the
 * current virtual time. This lets a simulation fully control both "what time
 * is it" and "what has arrived by now" independently of wall-clock time.

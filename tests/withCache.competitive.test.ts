 * specific outcome for a specific scenario, it constructs a fixed access
 * trace with known per-destination cost/confidence, computes the true
 * minimum-possible total refetch cost for that exact trace via an
 * exhaustive dynamic-programming search over eviction schedules (the

/**
 * Optimal offline eviction cost for a fixed trace, computed by exhaustive
 * search with memoization over (trace position, cache contents).
 *
 * Model: a request for a destination already in the cache set is free; a
 * request for one that isn't costs `cost(destination)` and, if the cache is
 * at capacity, requires evicting exactly one current member (or not caching
 * the new destination at all, which the search also considers). Filling
 * free capacity is never explored as "don't cache" since holding an
 * already-paid-for item at zero marginal cost can never make a future
 * decision worse — a standard reduction for this problem that shrinks the
 * branching factor without losing optimality.
 *
 * Confidence plays no role here deliberately: an omniscient scheduler with
 * perfect knowledge of the future trace has no need for a proxy signal like
 * confidence — it can just directly minimize real cost. Confidence is real
 * input to the *online* policy (which doesn't have future knowledge); the
 * offline baseline it's compared against only needs costs and the trace.

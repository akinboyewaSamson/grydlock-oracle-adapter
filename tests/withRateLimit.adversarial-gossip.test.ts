/**
 * Adversarial verification for `withRateLimit` (issue #73): simulates
 * multiple independent JS contexts sharing a single nominal budget,
 * coordinating only via a lossy, reordering, duplicating fake
 * `BroadcastChannel`, and checks the two bounds documented in
 * `src/middleware/withRateLimit.ts`'s module doc:
 *
 * 1. **Bound 1 (hard, unconditional)**: combined admissions across all
 *    contexts in any trailing window never exceeds `N * budget`. This must
 *    hold on every single randomized adversarial run — it's proven true by
 *    construction, independent of what the network does.
 * 2. **Bound 2 (soft, demonstrates convergence)**: once gossip has had time
 *    to propagate, the combined count settles much closer to the tight
 *    `budget + N` steady state than to the loose worst case — checked both
 *    under a lossless control (near-instant convergence expected) and under
 *    the full adversarial conditions (looser, but still well inside bound 1).

/**
 * Bounded-memory verification for `withRateLimit` (issue #73 constraint:
 * "O(1) amortized time and bounded memory per context, regardless of the
 * total number of gossip messages received over the process lifetime").
 *
 * Drives a single `withRateLimit` instance's real message listener (the
 * exact code path production gossip reception uses) with a very large
 * cumulative number of messages from a small, fixed, continuously-active
 * set of peer contexts, advancing a virtual clock so old buckets age out
 * and get pruned exactly as they would in a long-running process. If state
 * genuinely grew with lifetime message count rather than staying bounded by
 * the currently-active working set, heap growth per message would stay
 * roughly constant across checkpoints; if it's bounded, heap growth should
 * flatten out as later checkpoints receive far more messages than earlier
 * ones for comparable (small) additional heap cost.
 *
 * Like `tests/benchmarks/StubOracle.benchmark.test.ts`, heap measurements
 * are inherently a little noisy (GC timing, JIT warmup) — the comparison
 * below uses a generously slack multiplier specifically so it doesn't flake
 * on that noise while still clearly failing on genuine unbounded growth.
